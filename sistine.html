The Sistine Chapel is a Roman Catholic chapel in Vatican City, Rome. It was originally known as the Cappela Magna and was renamed by Pope Sixtus IV between 1477 and 1480 as it was being restored. Before Michelangelo painted the ceiling, an artist Piero Matteo d'Amelia painted a blue night sky with golden stars.
