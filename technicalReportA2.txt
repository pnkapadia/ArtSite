Our team improved our simple Art Gallery webpage by adding mroe features such as Blogs, list of Museums and also a shopping cart wherein visitors can purchase the artworks. 
We used Bootstrap to layout our webpage and do the header. Through the drop down menu on the header, you can access/open up our the blog page, creators page and the shopping page. 
Moreover, we also moved the list of the artist, artworks, and museums on our home page for easier access. 
We used Javascript on the header drop down menu. Moreover, we used simple HTML and CSS to do the other basic layout and style/design of our webpage.

We also used Javascript to implement the pop-up/dialogue box that shows the purchase/order form when the shopping cart and the name of the artist/artwork is clicked. 
Lastly, we used PHP to process the purchase form submitted by the customer.
