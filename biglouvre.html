		The Louvre Museum in Paris, France is one of the biggest museums in the world and it displays about 380, 000 pieces of art in total although not all art pieces shown to the public. The Musee du Louvre wasn't originally a museum, it was a fortress built in 1190. Then it was turned into a royal palace in the 16th century, and the French Monarchy moved to another location and opened the Louvre Museum to the public.
